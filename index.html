					<h1>Operational Transforms</h1>
					<p>For fun and profit (?)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What is Operational Transforms?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<blockquote>Operational transformation (OT) is a technology for supporting a range of collaboration functionalities in advanced collaborative software systems.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>But what's it do?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>It solves a very specific problem, but it solves that problem very well.</p>
				</section>				
				<section>
					<p>Real-time collaborative editing is trivial in a world where there's never any latency, 
						<span class="fragment">unreliable connections, </span>
						<span class="fragment">unreliable clients </span>						
						<span class="fragment">or the kind weird failures that always occur in distributed systems.</span>						
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						It solves the problem of:
					</p>
						<span class="fragment">
							If both users X and Y edit the same piece of data, how do we merge them to preserve the <strong>intent</strong> of both users edits?
						</span>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Example time!</h2>
				</section>
				<section class="stack">
					<section>
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs javascript>">
// Our piece of data
let text = "go";

// Let us assume two separate edits from two separate users

// User 1 adds an "a" after two characters, resulting 
// in the string "got"
let user1_operation = text.retain(2).insertCharacter('t')

// User 2 adds an "t" after two characters, resulting 
// in the string "goa"
let user2_operation = text.retain(2).insertCharacter('a')						
								</code>
						</pre>
						<p class="fragment">
							Now, without operational transforms - we have a problem.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							If we just naively send the operations to each user, we end up with two different views of the string - since the local operation will complete way ahead of any transmitted operation.</p>						
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs javascript">
// If User 1 receives User 2's operation
let text = "gota"

// If User 2 receives User 1's operation
let text = "goat"								
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p class="fragment whisper" style="font-size:16px;">
							( the above statement is only practically true - in theory, you can't say which of the two you'll end up with - the problem still holds... )
						</p>
					</section>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Transforms to the rescue!</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>What if we could resolve conflicts on the go (that is - so the user never sees them), and focus on the 
						<strong>intent</strong> of the changes?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The magic!</h3>
					<p>Operational Transforms allows a server to establish an order of operations, and then transform incoming operations against the current state in way that they represent the <strong>intent</strong> of the change.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="stack">
					<section>
					<pre>
						<code class="hljs javascript">
// When User 1 (and server) receives the operation, it'll 
// transform it using its known state from:
text.retain(2).insert('a')

// into
text.retain(2).insert('a').retain(1)

// resulting in 
text = "goat"
						</code>
					</pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Meanwhile, User 2 (and the server) has received the other operation:</p>
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs javascript">
text.retain(2).insert('t')

// which transforms into
text.retain(3).insert('t')

// resulting in 
text = "goat"
							</code>
						</pre>
					</section>
					</section>
				<section>
					<p>And boom - the text match on both clients and the server.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size:16px">
						Note - it's technically possible to do OT without a central server, but it's A LOT harder and not
					something we cover here.</p>
					</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size:16px">
						Note #2 - Examples above assume that the servers receipt-order of operations is first User 2, then User 1. It doesn't matter which the true order actually is, since the transform-step is idempontent.</p>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>So, that's why it works - HOW does it work?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Operational Transforms rely on a few key rules in order to work.</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">
							All operations span the entire length of the data.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Operations can either delete, keep or add. There's no replace <span class="fragment">unless you implement it as a delete + keep.</span>
						</li>
					</ol>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Which is why, in our example:</p>
					<pre>
						<code class="hljs javascript">
// When User 1 (and server) receives the operation, it'll 
// transform it using its known state from:
text.retain(2).insert('a')

// into
text.retain(2).insert('a').retain(1)

// resulting in 
text = "goat"
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size:20px;">
						there's a retain(1) added after the transform
					</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size:20px;">
						since the local instance already knows that the data is 3 characters long, and the incoming operation includes an insert-operation with a length of 1.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Labtime!</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a href="https://jsbin.com/gipicavixo/1/edit?js,console" target="_blank">JSBIN</a>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Thus, we can see that by always enforcing that operations span the entire length, it's always mathematically
					possible to calculate the actual transform.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Which, in theory, allows us to do the exact same thing across, for example, a JSON-document.</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						The tricky part is writing the transform that composes a set of operations into one operation for a given string.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>So, how do we to this with rich text?</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>By treating even an embed as an insert-operation of course!</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						<pre>
							<code class="hljs javascript">
text.insert({image: 'PATH_TO_IMAGE'})
.retain(2)
.insert({embed: 'YOUTUBE_URL'})
							</code>
						</pre>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The transform doesn't care how we render it - so the actual rendering of the embed has nothing to do with resolving a conflict of a text edit in the same place.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What about actually sending the transforms and persisting them?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>In theory, that's completely separate from operational transforms. In practice, you use websockets and persist snapshots.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How do we best persist a document that we manage using Operational Transforms when it's at rest?</h3>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size:16px">"at rest" is OT-term for "no active edit sessions".</p>
				</section>	
				<section>
					<p>You can always represent an inert document as a single insert operation, with the entire text (if not rich text), or as an array of insert-operations (if rich text).</p>
					<pre>
						<code class="hljs javascript">
{"ops":[
	{"insert":"Hej! Vem där??  - Hmm, realtid mellan "},
	{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"devices"},
	{"insert":" - det verkar "},
	{"attributes":{"italic":true},"insert":"väl"},
	{"insert":" fett...japp, visst gör det? med styling och allt...."}
]}
						</code>
					</pre>
					<p style="font-size:16px;">Note the rendering instructions to the rich text engine that's part of the operation.</p>
